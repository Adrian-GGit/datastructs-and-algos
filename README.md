# Data structures and algorithms
This repository contains the implementation of different popular data structures and algorithms written in Python and C++. Partially related to lectures from the KIT but also related to different coding challenges of different judges like [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), ... The main purpose of this repository is to get hands-dirty with all of the popular data structures and algorithms and for coding experience.
